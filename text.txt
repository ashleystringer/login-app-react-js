Login app

- Login page
    - The component the user can access by default
    - The user can access the SignUp component via this component
- Sign up page
- Log out page
- Landing page
    - If user is logged in, display "Log out"
- Confirmation page
    - Reload after a certain time to the landing page 

- Question
    - Is there going to be a point where I used context providers or custom hooks?

- Error component
    - What I want:
        - For this component to be used when an error is thrown
        - Regardless of where in the program
    - Scenarios
        - Login component
            - A username isn't found
            - An incorrect password is given
        - SignUp component 
            - Email is already in use
            - Username is already in use 
            - Password doesn't follow requirements
            - Passwords typed don't match

Later 
- Maybe write a simple backend for this using something like Express.
